## Development
Dependencies and environment is all built and managed with [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) the package manager. Please make sure you have that installed.

Run `nix develop` to drop into a dev shell with all dependencies available.

You can have it do this automatically by installing [direnv](https://direnv.net/) and allowing the directory.
